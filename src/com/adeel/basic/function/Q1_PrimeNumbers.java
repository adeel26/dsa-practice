/*
Second Method
âœ… Meaning:
We only check divisors up to the square root of n (âˆšn).

âœ… Why:
Because if n has a divisor greater than âˆšn,
then the corresponding other divisor will be smaller than âˆšn.
So, by the time we reach âˆšn, weâ€™ve already checked all possible smaller divisors.

--------------------------

ðŸ”¹ The key idea
If a number n is not prime, it can be written as
n = a Ã— b

Now notice this:

If both a and b were greater than âˆšn,
then their product would be greater than n, which is impossible.

So at least one of them must be â‰¤ âˆšn.

ðŸ‘‰ This means:
If n has any divisor other than 1 and itself,
one of them will be â‰¤ âˆšn.

ðŸ”¹ Example
Take n = 36

âˆš36 = 6
The pairs of factors are:

1 Ã— 36
2 Ã— 18
3 Ã— 12
4 Ã— 9
6 Ã— 6


After 6, the pairs just repeat in reverse:

9 Ã— 4
12 Ã— 3
18 Ã— 2
36 Ã— 1

So you only need to check divisors up to 6, not all the way to 35.

ðŸ”¹ Why we write divisor * divisor <= number

Because instead of calculating the actual square root (which is a slow floating-point operation),
we just compare:
divisor * divisor <= number
Thatâ€™s the same as:
divisor <= âˆšnumber
but faster and without using Math.sqrt().

âœ… In short:
We only loop while divisor * divisor <= number because:
If no divisor â‰¤ âˆšn divides n,
then no divisor > âˆšn can divide it either.
So the number must be prime.
