üß† 1. Yes ‚Äî the concept of memory (stack & heap) is universal
Almost all programming languages deal with two main memory regions:
MemoryArea	    Purpose
Stack	        Stores local (temporary) variables, function calls, return addresses
Heap	        Stores dynamically allocated data ‚Äî objects, arrays, data that lives beyond a function call

So, languages like Java, C, C++, Python, C#, Go, etc. all use the stack + heap model at their core.
But üëá


‚öôÔ∏è 2. What‚Äôs different is how each language manages it
Each language and runtime handles stack/heap differently:

C / C++
Memory Management: Manual
Details: You allocate (malloc / new) and free (free / delete) yourself.
Notes: Mistakes can cause memory leaks or crashes.

Java
Memory Management: Automatic (Garbage Collector)
Details: JVM allocates on heap for objects and frees unused memory automatically.

Python
Memory Management: Automatic (Reference Counting + Garbage Collector)
Details: Python‚Äôs interpreter handles memory automatically, similar to Java but slower.

C# (.NET)
Memory Management: Automatic (Garbage Collector + Stack for value types)
Details: Works similarly to Java‚Äôs model but optimized for .NET environment.

Go
Memory Management: Automatic (Optimized Garbage Collector)
Details: Uses stack allocation with escape analysis for efficient memory use.
So ‚Äî concept is same, but management differs.


üß© 3. How the OS fits in
Yes, memory ultimately comes from the operating system ‚Äî the language/runtime just requests it.
Think of it like this:

Your Program (Java, C++, Python)
   ‚Üì
Runtime or Compiler (JVM, CPython, etc.)
   ‚Üì
Operating System (Windows / Linux / macOS)
   ‚Üì
Physical Memory (RAM)

The OS provides memory when the program starts (via system calls like malloc, VirtualAlloc, etc.).
The language runtime (like JVM or Python interpreter) divides that memory into stack and heap.
So, the rules differ by language, but the foundation is the same ‚Äî all rely on the OS‚Äôs memory management APIs.


‚ö° Summary Thought:
Stack & Heap exist everywhere ‚Äî
what changes is who‚Äôs responsible for allocating and freeing them:
You (in C/C++)
The runtime (in Java, Python, Go, etc.)
